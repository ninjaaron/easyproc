*easyproc* is a very thin wrapper on the new ``suprocess.run()``
function in Python 3.5, just to simplify administrative scripting a bit.
It addresses what I perceive to be three shortcomings in the Popen API
(in order of egregiousness)

1. Input and output streams default to bytes. This is manifestly
   ridiculous in Python 3. easyproc turns on
   *universal_newlines* everywhere, so you don't have to worry about
   decoding bytes.
2. Piping a chain of processes together is not particularly intuitive
   and takes a lot of extra work when not using shell=True.
   ``easyproc.pipe()`` provides a simple way to pipe a chain of shell
   commands into each other without the safety risk of granting a shell.
   Admittedly, if one is piping together a lot of shell commands, one
   might wonder why bother with python at all? Or better, why not use
   native python filters? Certainly, that is the preferable option in
   situations were "shelling out" creates a performance bottle-neck, but
   there are times where the performance cost is small, and, in terms of
   development speed, shell utilities are often ideally suited to
   parsing the output of shell commands. Easy things should be easy,
   right?
3. While not particularly egregious, and sometimes even useful, it can
   be annoying to split each command argument into a separate list item.
   easyproc commands can be strings or lists. If it's a string, it's run
   through ``shlex.split()`` prior to being passed to
   ``subprocess.run()``.

*easyproc* does not replace all the functionality of the subprocess
module by a long shot, but it does try to expose much of it by passing
additional kwargs to ``subprocess.run()``, so many advanced use-cases
should be possible, and one need only refer to the documentation for the
subprocess module.

*easyproc* provides four simple functions for messing with shell
commands. ``easyproc.run()`` simply runs the command you give it through
``shlex.split()`` if it is a string, and then sends it to
``suprocess.run()`` with *universal_newlines* turned on, and all
additional kwargs passed along as well. ``easyproc.Popen()`` does the
same, but it returns a Popen instance, in case you need to interact with
a running process.

``easyproc.grab()`` is like ``easyproc.run()``, but it captures the
stdout of the command. By default, it also splits the output into a list
of lines, since many commands return output that is intended to be
processed line by line. Turn off this behavior with *split=False*. Note
that this catches errors. Use *check=False* to disable.

``easyproc.pipe()`` takes any number of commands as args and pipes them
into each other in the order they are given. The output is captured and
split, as with ``easyproc.grab()``, unless otherwise specified. if you
plan on passing a lot of subprocess.run/Popen parameters to
easyproc.pipe, you may want to look at the doc string to see what it
will do.

*easyproc* also provides the three special variables from the subprocess
module, ``PIPE``, ``STDOUT``, and ``DEVNULL``, for those who know and
care what they do.

While the ``input`` parameter for easyproc functions is inherited
directly from ``suprocess.run()``, it may be useful for those avoiding
the subprocess docs to here note that this parameter is used to pass
text to the STDIN of a command (and doesn't require the use of
stdin=PIPE); i.e. it's like ``echo "text"|command``. In suprocess, the
text must be bytes by default. In easyproc, as with all other streams,
it ought to be a string.
